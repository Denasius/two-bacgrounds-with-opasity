# for correctly work with 2 backgrounds it needs to write the next code in HTML
# for example:
# <section class="className-1 className-2 className-n"></section>
# it means that in section we have to specify some names for one class
# if we plan to work with any CMS we need to specify background in HTML code, like this:
# <section class="className-1 className-2 className-n" style="background-image:url(img/...)"></section>
# after this we need to work with styles
